# vue-cli-test

working example of `CSInterface` inside a vue-cli build.

**NOTE:** You must run the `npm run dev` command prior to opening your app (at least for AI):

```
npm run dev
```

* See `./CSXS/` for notes on `manifest.xml` file for nodeJS.

* See `index-dev.html` and `index.html`. `index-dev.html` is pointed to in `manifest.xml`, which itself contains the PORT: parameter to `index.html` in your `webpack.config.js` file (line #52).
